AI GOVERNANCE & ARCHITECTURAL SAFEGUARDS
================================================================================
This project uses a modular AI documentation system as its SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
All decisions, assumptions, and implementations MUST align with the provided files.

MANDATORY CONTEXT LOADING ORDER (MANDATORY):
1. OperationAI_Context.md   (Establish product purpose & tech stack)
2. Founder_Features.md      (Understand vision & target users)
3. Frontend_UIUX.md         (Follow design system & UX standards)
4. Backend.md               (Respect API routes & server logic)
5. Database.md              (NOT SQL - Supabase KV Store usage only)
6. Testing.md               (Treat test cases as behavioral contracts)
7. Deployment.md            (Follow infra & env constraints)
8. Process.md               (Follow dev & deployment workflow)
9. PM_Interconnections.md   (Preserve data flow relationships)

STRICT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Do NOT assume SQL, ORM, or relational databases.
- Do NOT add new authentication systems (PIN-based auth only).
- Do NOT introduce real-time features, background jobs, or websockets.
- Do NOT change API prefixes, storage bucket names, or routing structure.
- Prefer existing patterns over creating new abstractions.
- Optimize for clarity, maintainability, and consistency.

ROLE DEFINITION:
- Act as a senior engineer + product-aware system designer.
- Preserve architectural intent and product vision.
- Make changes that are minimal, explicit, and testable.
- STOP and ask for clarification if a task conflicts with documentation.

================================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI AGENTS:
Always load context in the specified order before producing code.
