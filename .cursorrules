# Project Context & AI Guidelines

You are an AI programming assistant working on the "Design Log Tracker" repository. 
You must STRICTLY adhere to the contextual requirements of this project, which prioritizes tracking engineering decisions in a simple, fast interface.

## Mandatory Reading
Before making any architectural, API, or deep UI changes, you MUST read the following file in its entirety:
`ForAIContext.txt` (located in the project root)

That file outlines the required reading order for the documents inside `documentation/ai_context`. Do NOT skip this step if you are asked to implement a new feature.

## Core Rules
1. **No SQL or Relational Databases:** This project relies entirely on Supabase KV store (`@supabase/kv`). Do not install Prisma, Drizzle, or any SQL drivers. Look at `supabase/functions/server` for how data is handled.
2. **Minimalism & Speed:** Do not introduce heavy dependencies or complex state machines (e.g., Redux). The app uses React context and custom hooks (see `src/app/hooks`).
3. **No Real-time Features:** We do not use websockets or Supabase real-time subscriptions. The app is strictly HTTP-based for logging.
4. **Authentication:** The app uses local PIN-based authentication. Do not rewrite auth to use Supabase Auth, OAuth, or JWTs.

## Style Conventions
- **UI Components:** Use Radix UI and the existing Tailwind CSS setup in `src/app/components/ui`.
- **TypeScript:** Always enforce strong typing. Use the interfaces defined in `src/app/components/types.ts`. Avoid `any`.
- **File Structure:** 
  - `src/app/components/` for purely UI/presentational elements.
  - `src/app/hooks/` for business logic and data fetching.
  - `src/app/api/` for API client functions talking to the Supabase Edge Function.
